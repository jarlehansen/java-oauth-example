## OAuth
OAuth is an open standard for authorization that enables clients to obtain access to protected server resources on behalf of a resource owner.
The resource owner could be a different client or the end user.
OAuth also helps end users authorize third-party access to their server resources without having to share their credentials, such as username and password.
